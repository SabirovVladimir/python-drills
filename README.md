## ⚡ Python Tasks: The Struggle Is Real ⚡  

### "Write simple, readable code," they said.  
### "It'll be fun," they said.  

Welcome to this **dumpster fire** of Python solutions. Every script here was either born out of curiosity, frustration, or a pure, unfiltered lack of concern for best practices.  

## 🔥 What’s in this branch?  
A collection of **solutions** to problems that no one asked for. Some are elegant, some are borderline war crimes against clean code. Either way, they **work**, and that's what matters.  

## 🛠 How to run these gems  
1. Clone the repo, if you dare:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SabirovVladimir/python-drills.git

## 🖤 Things you’ll probably see in this repo
Overuse of lambda where a function should exist
try-except blocks that catch everything because I refuse to debug
List comprehensions that should be illegal
A healthy dose of print(f"Debug: {variable}")
Commented-out code I was too scared to delete

## ❌ Who is this repo NOT for?
People who worship PEP-8
Developers who think recursion is "elegant"
Anyone looking for "best practices"

## 👊 Contributing
If your code makes someone say "WTF?" but still runs, you're welcome to contribute. Just make sure:

It works (at least once).
You can explain it in one sentence, even if that sentence is "I don’t know why it works, but it does."
You embrace the madness.
